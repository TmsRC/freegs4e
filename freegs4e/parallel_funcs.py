"""
Custom parallel library for use in FreeGS4E, based on Python threading for GIL
releasing operations. Wraps expensive numpy and scipy functions with parallel
implementations. Relies on numexpr for threadpool size control.

    Parallel wrapper for both scipy.special.ellipe() and scipy.special.ellipk(). Behavior of

    On 2 threads, both integrals are simply calculated simultaneously. For larger threadpools,
    k2 is divided into slices and each thread calculates one of the integrals on its
    corresponding slice. If an odd number of threads was set, the next lower even number is
    used.

    Parameters
    ----------

    k2 is divided into slices and each thread clips its corresponding slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k2 : ndarray
        Array containing the elements to clip
    a_min, a_max : array_like or None
        Minimum and maximum value. If ``None``, clipping is not performed on

    out : ndarray, optional
